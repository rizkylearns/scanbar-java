..CaptureActivity is the Activity that display camera decoder
..CaptureActivityHandler handles all the activity messages
.Handler classes handle incoming Android <int> messages in handleMessage(Message) method
.Handler classes performs outging <int>_identified message in sendMessage(Message) method
.Thread.run method can contain Looper.prepare() /handler initialization/ Looper.loop() to include this thread to
  listen to incoming message and send outgoing message
.CameraManager class encapsulates android Camera object to control Camera related operation. It contains
  CameraConfigurationManager that further reads and calculates Camera object attributes
.CameraManager can create LuminanceSource object instances built from camera byte[] YUV data with the barcode framing
  dimensions
.CaptureActivity has CameraManager
.DecodeThread runs the decoding in its thread
.DecodeThread has DecodeHandler that does the actual byte[] decoding into raw Result object. Result has getText() method
.Decoding process is run in DecodeHandler; running: buildLuminanceSource[byte[] + frame dimension from camera]
  ->createBinarizer[from luminanceSource object, creator of YUV to Bit (1/0) data]
  ->createBinaryBitmap[an encapsulates actual Bit(1/0) data as BitArray (1D bit array) or
    BitMatrix (2D bit array with dimension)]->createRawResult[using Reader object, decodes BitMap]
  ->sendDecodeSuccededOrFailedToAMessageHandler[if successful, parse result, if failed request to camera another frame]
..CaptureActivity encapsulates all visualization in the decoding display


last step: recreate:
one capture activity, one lists captured activity.

1.break it down
.(X) create a layout that enables camera
.(X) create activity class that opens camera
..(X)use activity class to obtain some basic info from camera data, or:
..(X) finish this project and collect scanned result in history
.(X)create a layout that list strings
.(X)create activity for the list layout
..(X) create a temporary button on the camera view layout
..(X)adjust the camera activity to send intent to list activity to send a predefined string
.. (X) adjust the camera activity to have a method that accepts a string parameter and show it on a list view
